## Computational advertising

* informally: advertising on the internet, or in any electronic media (future TV)
* more formally: automatically finding the best advertisement for a particualr user in a particular context, using data mining, ML and algo techniques
* particular user: a particular person, person with a certain history, member of a certain group, in a certain region
* computational advertising pays the bills on the web

## Traditional advertising

* huge industry
* developed over the last centuries, but particularly in the last few decades
* influenced by Psychology, how to manipulate
* TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, direct email, leaflets, billboards, yellow pages, flyer
* creative side and deal-making
* shaped by physical constraints
* not very personalized
* effects hard to measure

## From traditional to computational advertising

* everything is moving to the internet (also ads)
* computational advertising takes up larger share
* NYC: center of traditional ad industry
* now lots of CompAdv startups + old ones to follow
* Internet: no physical constaints
* And more user context -> personalization
* and more knowledge of outcome -> did it work?
* attack of the nerds


## Who pays and how to pay

* pay per impression (PPI)
* pay per click (PPC)
* pay per action (PPA)
* also called charging event
* advertiser pays
* publisher and match maker get paid

## Auctions (竞价排名？？)

* different parties submit bids for an item
* open or closed, single or multiple rounds
* first and second price auctions, dutch auction
* second price auction ?
* proof by case analysis
* search uses Generalized second price auction
* generalized: pay k+1 th hightest price for the kth slot???
* PPC: take probability of click into account

这个可能只是了解了一丢丢

## Ad search engines

* systems for returning best ads given features
* for search ads and content match
* features: search and ad keywords, landing pages, user browsing/search/purchase history etc...
* very high-dimensional search problem
* meaning, keywords not as dominant
* ad engines receive tens of billions of queries/day
For each query, and for many pages views

## Click Fraud

* to get advertising money (content match)
* to deplete competition's budget
* to manipualte auctions and prices
* (or to increase rank of your site by clicking on it)



## Computational advertising research

* 3 main types of approaches/directions
    * IR approaches: ad retrieval as a search problem
    * mechanism deisgn, auctions, and game theory
    * optimization problems in dispaly advertising

* Others
    * web/user mining
    * privacy and privacy-perserving advertising
    * scalability issues in ad engines
